# AI_Writing_Buddy
An AI that makes writers think about their stories in a deeper way, asking appropriate questions based on the content it reads.

In a world where AI seems to be doing more and more things FOR us, I feel like it is important that creativity remains all our own.
This is what this project aims to achieve, using AI to enhance a writer's creativity by asking appropriate questions, never actually writing anything on its own, resulting in the writer having their work be all their own. There is nothing better than feeling proud of something you created, the idea behind this AI program is to ease that creative process, help writers see things differently, in ways they never considered, through appropriate questions that the AI will ask based on the content in a Google Docs.
